## Hobbies
Growing up, I used to spend the majority of my time reading books. _The Magic Tree House_, _Geronimo Stilton_, _Thea Stilton_ were some of the many books that fueled my imagination and love for fantasy worlds. Now, amidst the hustle of life and school, I escape into fantasy worlds created by my favorite authors whenever I can. Photography has also become one of my growing passions. I aim to perfect it and capture the world's beauty as I see it.
