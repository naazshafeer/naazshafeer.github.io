title: About Me
I am a sophomore undergraduate studying Physics/Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I am currently in a Cosmology Research Group with Professor Kris Pardo and working closely with the graduate student, Mya Do. (I don't know what else to write here T_T)


title: Hobbies
Growing up, I used to spend the majority of my time reading books. _The Magic Tree House_, _Geronimo Stilton_, _Thea Stilton_ were on of the many books that had garnered my penchant for thinking outside the box- to imagine a world inside the confines of my mind. Now, in the hustle of life and school, I use any time that I have to escape into a fantasy world created by favorite authors. Photography has also become one of my growing passions this year. I aim to perfect it (as much as I can) and capture the world as I see in its beauty. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
