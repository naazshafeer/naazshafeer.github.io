Growing up, I used to spend the majority of my time reading books. _The Magic Tree House_, _Geronimo Stilton_, _Thea Stilton_ were on of the many books that had garnered my penchant for thinking outside the box- to imagine a world inside the confines of my mind. Now, in the hustle of life and school, I use any time that I have to escape into a fantasy world created by favorite authors. Photography has also become one of my growing passions this year. I aim to perfect it (as much as I can) and capture the world as I see in its beauty.
